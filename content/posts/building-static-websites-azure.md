# Building Modern Static Websites with Azure

Static websites have made a huge comeback in recent years, and for good reason. They're fast, secure, cost-effective, and perfect for many use cases including personal blogs, portfolios, documentation sites, and even complex applications when combined with modern JavaScript frameworks.

In this post, I'll walk you through how to build and deploy a modern static website using Azure Storage, complete with Infrastructure as Code using Terraform.

## Why Choose Static Sites?

Before diving into the technical implementation, let's understand why static sites are so compelling:

### 🚀 Performance
- **Lightning-fast load times** - No server-side processing means instant page loads
- **Global distribution** - CDNs can serve your content from edge locations worldwide
- **Caching efficiency** - Static files cache beautifully at every level

### 🛡️ Security
- **Reduced attack surface** - No database or server-side code to exploit
- **HTTPS by default** - Modern hosting platforms provide SSL certificates automatically
- **No server maintenance** - Fewer moving parts mean fewer security vulnerabilities

### 💰 Cost-Effectiveness
- **Minimal hosting costs** - Static storage is incredibly cheap
- **No server resources** - No need to pay for compute time or server maintenance
- **Efficient bandwidth usage** - Optimized delivery through CDNs

### 📈 Scalability
- **Handle traffic spikes** - CDNs can handle massive traffic without breaking a sweat
- **Global reach** - Serve users from the closest geographic location
- **No capacity planning** - The platform handles scaling automatically

## Azure Storage Static Websites

Azure Storage offers an excellent platform for hosting static websites with several key features:

### Built-in Features
- **Custom domain support** with automatic HTTPS
- **Integration with Azure CDN** for global performance
- **$web container** for organized file storage
- **Custom error pages** (like 404.html)
- **Index document configuration**

### Cost Structure
Azure Storage for static websites is incredibly cost-effective:
- **Storage costs**: ~$0.02 per GB per month
- **Transaction costs**: ~$0.0004 per 10,000 operations
- **Bandwidth**: Free for first 5GB per month, then ~$0.087 per GB

For a typical personal blog or portfolio, you're looking at less than $1 per month!

## Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

Let's look at the Terraform configuration that powers this blog:

```hcl
# Random suffix for unique storage account name
resource "random_string" "storage_suffix" {
  length  = 8
  special = false
  upper   = false
}

# Resource group to contain all resources
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg-website" {
  name     = "website-rg"
  location = var.location
  tags     = var.tags
}

# Storage account for static website hosting
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "sa-website" {
  name                     = "website${random_string.storage_suffix.result}"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.rg-website.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.rg-website.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
  tags                     = var.tags

  # Enable static website hosting
  static_website {
    index_document     = "index.html"
    error_404_document = "404.html"
  }
}

# Output the website URL
output "website_url" {
  value       = azurerm_storage_account.sa-website.primary_web_endpoint
  description = "URL of the static website"
}
```

### Key Configuration Choices

**Storage Account Tier**: We use `Standard` tier with `LRS` (Locally Redundant Storage) because:
- It's the most cost-effective option for static websites
- Static content doesn't require high availability storage
- We can add CDN for global distribution separately

**Random Suffix**: Storage account names must be globally unique, so we generate a random suffix to avoid conflicts.

**Tags**: Proper resource tagging helps with cost management and organization.

## Modern Development Stack

For this blog, I'm using a carefully chosen modern static site approach:

### Frontend Technologies
```javascript
// Example of modern JavaScript used in the blog
class BlogManager {
    constructor() {
        this.posts = [];
        this.currentPage = 1;
        this.postsPerPage = 6;
    }

    async loadBlogData() {
        const response = await fetch('./data/posts.json');
        const data = await response.json();
        this.posts = data.posts.filter(post => post.published);
        this.renderPosts();
    }

    renderPosts() {
        // Client-side rendering for dynamic content
        const postsContainer = document.getElementById('blogPosts');
        const postsHTML = this.posts.map(post => this.renderPostCard(post)).join('');
        postsContainer.innerHTML = postsHTML;
    }
}
```

### Content Management
- **Markdown source files** for easy writing and version control
- **Automated conversion** to JSON during build process
- **Frontmatter support** for metadata and SEO
- **GitHub Actions** for continuous deployment

### Build Process
```bash
# Local development
npm run dev          # Process markdown and start local server
npm run build        # Process markdown files to JSON

# GitHub Actions handles:
# 1. Markdown processing
# 2. Terraform infrastructure deployment
# 3. Static file deployment to Azure
```

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### 1. Asset Optimization
```css
/* Critical CSS inlined in HTML head */
.hero {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
    /* Use efficient gradients instead of images when possible */
}

/* Non-critical CSS loaded asynchronously */
```

### 2. Image Optimization
- **WebP format** for modern browsers with fallbacks
- **Lazy loading** for images below the fold
- **Responsive images** with appropriate sizes
- **Image compression** during the build process

### 3. JavaScript Optimization
```javascript
// Use modern ES6+ features for smaller bundles
const utils = {
    debounce: (func, wait) => {
        let timeout;
        return function executedFunction(...args) {
            const later = () => {
                clearTimeout(timeout);
                func(...args);
            };
            clearTimeout(timeout);
            timeout = setTimeout(later, wait);
        };
    }
};

// Lazy load non-critical functionality
if ('IntersectionObserver' in window) {
    // Progressive enhancement
    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(handleIntersection);
}
```

### 4. Caching Strategy
```html
<!-- Cache static assets aggressively -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css?v=1.0.0">
<script src="js/blog.js?v=1.0.0"></script>

<!-- Content files can be cached for shorter periods -->
<script>
    fetch('./data/posts.json', {
        cache: 'no-cache' // Always get fresh content
    });
</script>
```

## Deployment Pipeline

The complete deployment process is automated through GitHub Actions:

1. **Content Processing**
   - Convert Markdown files to JSON
   - Generate metadata and search indices
   - Optimize images and assets

2. **Infrastructure Deployment**
   - Run Terraform to ensure infrastructure is up-to-date
   - Handle any configuration changes
   - Output deployment URLs and status

3. **Static File Deployment**
   - Upload processed files to Azure Storage
   - Invalidate CDN cache if configured
   - Verify deployment success

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Built-in Azure Metrics
- **Request counts** and response times
- **Error rates** and status codes
- **Geographic distribution** of requests
- **Bandwidth usage** and costs

### Custom Analytics
```javascript
// Lightweight analytics for static sites
class Analytics {
    constructor() {
        this.sessionStart = Date.now();
        this.events = [];
    }

    track(event, data = {}) {
        // Send to your analytics service of choice
        this.events.push({
            event,
            data,
            timestamp: Date.now(),
            url: window.location.href
        });
    }
}

// Track meaningful user interactions
analytics.track('blog_post_read', {
    title: document.title,
    readTime: calculateReadTime()
});
```

## SEO Considerations

Static sites are excellent for SEO when configured properly:

### Meta Tags and Structure
```html
<!-- Dynamic meta tags based on content -->
